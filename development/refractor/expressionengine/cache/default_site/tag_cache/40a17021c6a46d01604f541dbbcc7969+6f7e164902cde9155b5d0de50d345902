            <h3>How did Linklater work with the passing of time in &#8220;Boyhood&#8221;</h3>
            <p>Albeit fictional, "Boyhood" aspires towards documentary form by consciously opening up to reality, particularly by showing the real life effect of time on the actors, whether through aging or the experiences in their own personal lives.</p>

            <h3>Who is Stefan Zweig? Why does he receive the first credit at the end of &#8220;The Grand Budapest Hotel&#8221;</h3>
            <p>Even though Austrian author Stefan Zweig was not involved with the making of "The Grand Budapest Hotel," he still receives the first credit at the end of the film.  Why? Because Zweig's writings inspired the film. Zweig was an exile, like Zero Moustafa, the protagonist.  Of his writings, the film seems particularly reminiscent of “The World of Yesterday,” which was written when Zweig was fleeing from the new Nazi regime.</p>
