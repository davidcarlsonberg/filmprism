	  <p>How many times have you walked out of a movie and had questions about what you just watched? Was Dom Cobb dreaming or awake in&nbsp;<em>Inception</em>? What actually happened at the end of&nbsp;<em>Black Swan</em>? &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Many of us gather with friends to discuss and analyze the films or TV programs we just watched.&nbsp; Or, we surf the Internet searching for explanations to a show we&#39;re watching while sitting on our couches. Now, for the first time, there is a platform for film and TV analysis where you can find answers to your questions, submit questions of your own and engage in dialogue with other like minded movie enthusiasts. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
ScreenPrism offers you a centralized&nbsp;hub for film and TV analysis.&nbsp; Currently, we are&nbsp;building&nbsp;the largest digital library of film and television inquiry and related content by producing original articles, curating content from other esteemed sources and facilitating user generated comment and discussion.</p>
