        <p><em>Boyhood&nbsp;</em>portrays a very intimate, small-scale family drama, but the actual film itself feels epic in scale due to its structure, spanning across 12 years of shooting in order to follow a&nbsp;young boy&#39;s&nbsp;(Mason played by Ellar Coltrane) growth from childhood to&nbsp;adolescence and eventually into young adulthood. The filmmaking process for&nbsp;<em>Boyhood </em>is&nbsp;virtually unprecedented in the history of cinema &ndash; long-term projects encompassing a similar time frame as <em>Boyhood</em> typically only appear in&nbsp;documentaries (such as Michael Apted&rsquo;s <em>Up</em> series, which has been revisiting its subjects every seven years since 1964), and such projects are&nbsp;exceptionally rare.</p>

<p>Completing&nbsp;<em>Boyhood </em>represents a remarkable&nbsp;achievement because&nbsp;of the significant financial and logistical risks. &nbsp;Creator, writer&nbsp;and director Richard&nbsp;Linklater has&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest proposition to ask someone to help finance something for twelve years in our industry.&nbsp;[Jonathan Sehring at IFC] doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of films, and as years went on, I&rsquo;d run into him and he&rsquo;d say &lsquo;Well, we have one film in production.&rsquo; Every year, I just had a board meeting. Everyone asks what the hell this is on the books. He had to lie, every year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The process of making a film over a multi-year time period is virtually unprecented. &nbsp;Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut made four features and one short over 20 years based around the semi-autobiographical character Antoine Doinel (played by Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud), but each of those works were self-contained. Logistically, Truffaut&nbsp;produced the&nbsp;features like a series of sequels rather than one continuing project. This&nbsp;compendium of films more closely resembles&nbsp;Linklater&rsquo;s own <em>Before Sunrise</em>, <em>Before Sunset</em> and <em>Before Midnight</em> films, which were done in nine-year intervals but always were produced as individual sequels instead of one ongoing project. Another film,&nbsp;<em>Everyday</em>&nbsp;by Michael Winterbottom, which deals with&nbsp;a man&rsquo;s five-year imprisonment, was actually filmed over five years, shooting a few weeks at a time. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;besides being logistically simpler, <em>Everyday</em>&nbsp;also started years after <em>Boyhood</em> had already begun production.</p>
