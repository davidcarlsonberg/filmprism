        <p>J.C. Chandor, the writer and director of&nbsp;<em>A Most Violent Year</em>, explains that he set the film in 1981 New York because of the period&#39;s significance to New York history. &nbsp;During this time, the murder rate in New York was very high. &nbsp;Violent crimes, rape and robbery all hit 15-year highs in 1981. &nbsp;Chandor noted in an interview with The Huffington Post,&nbsp;"The film is playing off a lot of traditional themes in a gangster film, but it also plays against that in a lot of ways."</p>

<p>"There was something fascinating to me about the changes that have taken place in New York City in really a relatively short period of time," Chandor said in an&nbsp;interview with the Huffington Post. "I was looking for crime statistics. I realized all the budget cuts and horrible things that happened to New York during the 1970s actually peaked in 1981. The cool thing about 1981 is that it&#39;s also a real transition year: Ronald Reagan took office, Ed Koch was re-elected as New York City mayor, it was the first couple of years of rap exploding."</p>

<p>However, the film&#39;s two main characters, Abel and Anna Morales (Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain), a pair of&nbsp;upwardly mobile 30-somethings&nbsp;do not&nbsp;seem particularly&nbsp;interested in those pivotal cultural events. Chandor stated about Abel and Anna,&nbsp;"They&#39;re&nbsp;doing everything they can to isolate themselves from the difficulty of the period...The city slowly fights back, and creeps into their life."</p>
